Notes for this year. Doing all Python. Need to learn how to transition from thinking in PERL (after 30 years!) to thinking in Python.

| Day | Time | Comments |
| --- | ---- | -------- |
| 1   | minutes | Vector math; numpy |
| 2   | minutes | More vector math; numpy |
| 3   | minutes | Basic regex |
| 4   | ~1 hour | More numpy matrix stuff (started with regex but then part2 required a restart) |
| 5   | 15 min. | More array play with a dictionary. Brute force is still viable this early |
| 6   | 5 hrs. | Started with fancy ray-trace on corners, then tried obstacles in front of each nextpos, but then went with brute force with all possible obstacles on all voids and a set. |
| 7   | 30 min. | Python's combinatorial tools are kinda cheating. |
| 8   | 30 min. | Line walking with dictionaries and combinatorials. |
