Notes for this year. Doing all Python. Need to learn how to transition from thinking in PERL (after 30 years!) to thinking in Python.

| Day | Time | Comments |
| --- | ---- | -------- |
| 1   | minutes | Vector math; numpy |
| 2   | minutes | More vector math; numpy |
| 3   | minutes | Basic regex |
| 4   | ~1 hour | More numpy matrix stuff (started with regex but then part2 required a restart) |
